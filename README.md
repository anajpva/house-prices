# House Prices

## Project Overview
This project is an analysis and model training exercise based on a Kaggle dataset. The primary objectives include data exploration, feature engineering, and the training and evaluation of machine learning models. The project is divided into three Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Data Analysis**: This notebook focuses on exploring the dataset, visualizing trends, and identifying key features.
2. **Model Training**: Includes preprocessing steps and the implementation of machine learning models.
3. **Model Training (Full Dataset)**: Extends the model training process to work with the entire dataset for final evaluations.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from (Kaggle)[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques].

## References
This project used as references other similar exercises and publicly available projects. While specific projects are not directly cited here, you can explore Kaggle notebooks and GitHub repositories for additional references and methodologies. It is highly recommended to credit authors if you adapt their work.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository containing these notebooks.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file (if provided):
